# Project 3: Website Portfolio

Your task in this unit is to **build a multi-page website using basic html and css files** — as opposed to a site manager like WordPress or Wix — **along with any media assets you wish to embed.** (Any JavaScript or animation you want to add for interactivity is above and beyond expectations.) In assigning this, I have two main goals for you:

1. to learn how to manage a composite project made up of multiple interlinking files, and
2. to explore the affordances of the web design stack as a medium, and especially its ability to _flexibly render content for multiple audiences or reading priorities_.

As with the earlier projects, the selection of content is your choice. One relatively straightforward option for this unit is to stage and present the materials you produced earlier in the term; depending on your needs and interests, however, you can also develop this into a more sustainable and public-facing platform from which to manage your online identities, or a mock-up of demo content you can use to show off your web-design skills. Whatever you choose, you should _consider your audience(s) and how they might land on your website, and where you therefore wish to direct their attention and next steps._

As you start planning your composition, consider: What have you been working on, in or out of this class, that you'd like to show the world? What have you made, or done, or pursued? If someone were to search for you without using your name, what terms would they use in the search? What images would represent or resonate with your answers so far? Or: if the site won't focus on _you_, what group, or thing, or event would you prefer to represent, and in how many ways could you tag or subdivide _that_?

See if any terms or images come to mind when you think of your subject, then work back and forth from image to word and back.

## Generative constraints
_This is a starting point; we'll discuss and update in class next week, as has been our usual process._

**Baseline criteria**
For a minimum grade of B, all projects for this unit must:

* Use arrangement, size, color, visual rhythm, and/or contrast to focus viewers' attention.
* Include at least three navigable html locations
* Have a clear mode of navigation among the pages
* Include at least one css stylesheet
* Include at least one legally useable image, with alt text
* Successfully display locally in a web browser
* Argue in reflection why you did what you did

**Aspirational inspirations**
To target (but not guarantee) a grade above a B, the best projects for this unit may...

* Use Github Pages to load publicly over the Internet
* Use Jekyll (built into GitHub Pages) to deploy html templates and variables, which can help minimize repetition
* Use best practices for accessible design to build in features (like screen-reader-only navigation) as checked by the [WAVE web accessibility evaluation tool](http://wave.webaim.org/)
* Use best practices for responsive design (e.g. @media queries to resize elements for mobile vs desktop viewing)
* Include a loadable alternative stylesheet, a la CSS Zen Garden


## Deadlines and products
At each stage, unless otherwise specified, upload (push) your materials to your own copy of this assignment repository. I recommend that you **save often, using meaningful commit messages**; for best results, please keep your filenames clear, lowercase, and space-free (use hyphens or underscores).

If you are using Box, please nevertheless share a link to your Box folder prominently in your GitHub repository.

| Thurs Oct 31 | Website Portfolio Preview | An early snapshot of your progress, to get the gears turning. Turn in: <ul><li>A multifile <strong>project folder</strong>, containing a combination of html and css, even if it's not well-developed.</li><li> A static <strong><a href="https://www.take-a-screenshot.org/">screenshot</a> (.png or .jpg)</strong> of your website-in-progress, as rendered in a local web browser (for comparison later to subsequent drafts). <ul><li>(Optionally, take a screenshot of your Atom project setup, too.)</li></ul></li><li> A plain text (.txt) or markdown (.md) file, explaining in at least 300 words <strong>what you're showing us</strong> in this preview.

## A Note About Folders

If you look around in the default repo, you'll see that there are already a few subfolders created. These correspond to the folders that you'll be asked to make in the html/css tutorial I'm assigning for homework, and are my suggested way of organizing your space as you make your way through the exercises there.

Note, though, that you will have to create at least one more folder even for the first homework (for the fourth tutorial, "Hello, CSS"). And, presumably, many more (the tutorial has 14 chapters, though maybe not all of you will get that far).
